# CS2210: Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains assignments completed for CS2210 at Western University.

## Course Overview
CS2210 focuses on data structures, algorithms, and their design/selection for problem-solving. The course covers algorithm correctness, complexity analysis, and object-oriented implementation in Java.
